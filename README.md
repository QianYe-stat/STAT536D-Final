# STAT536D Final Assignment

## Some Thoughts about Prior Distribution and Sample Size in Bayesian Modeling

### Overview

This repository contains the my work for the STAT536D final assignment, including R code, simulation output, reference papers, and tex and pdf files for the report.

### What's in this repo

+ `/data`: Numerical output from the simulation study

+ `/figures`: Figures that summarize and visualize the numeric results from the simulation study

+ `/reference`" Reference papers and textbooks used in the report

+ `/report`: Latex files and generated PDF of report

+ `/src`: Source code for the simulations

### How to reproduce the simulation output

Enter `/src` and run the following R scripts step by step:

+ `00_independencies.R`: install all dependencies packages
+ `01_main.R`: run simulations and obtain numerical results
+ `02_summarize_output.R`: visualize the numerical results in figures
